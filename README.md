# GIF-Encoder 
A GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) encoder written in the C programming language.

The following gifs were created using my encoder. You can find the code for the ERR70_ GIF in [src/gif/GIFError.c](src/gif/GIFError.c), the code for the gradient GIF and other tests is located in [src/test](src/test/). Other generated GIF examples are located in the [examples](examples/) folder.
